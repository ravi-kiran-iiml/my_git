ELEMENTARY ARITHMETIC OPERATORS:
Here we will have a look at the basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, integer division, modulo (remainder) operator and exponent operator.
a = 2 # assign 2 to variable a
b = 3 # asssign 3 to variable b

print(a + b) # add operator 	5
print(a - b) # subtract operator	-1
print(a * b) # multiply operator	6
print(a / b) # division operator	0.6666666666666666
print(a // b) # greatest integer division operator	0
print(a % b) # modulo operator OR remainder operator	2
print(a ** b) # exponent operator	8
